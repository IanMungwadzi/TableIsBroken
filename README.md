- 👋 Hi, I’m Ian Mungwadzi.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming an officer in the Royal Corps of Signals.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning A-Level Computer Science, Chemistry and Physics
- 💞️ I don't have the experience required for any collaborations, maybe come back in a few year's time.
- 📫 I'm learning C#, since that's what we use at college.
